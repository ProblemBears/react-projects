REACT SUMMARY & CORE FEATURES
    -How React Works and                        * A Component is a regular JS function that returns something that can be rendered ( Ex: plain text, but usually JSX (JS HTML) )
     Understanding Components:                  * These components should reside in their own .js files and be exported in a CommonJS style (Ex: export default App;)

    -Building & Re-Using Another                * CONVENTION:   ** Place new .js components in a ./src/components directory
     Component:                                                 ** Component names should start with a capital letter (ex: function SomeComponent() {})

                                                * Import with:  ** import SomeComponent from './components/SomeComponent'
                                                
                                                * THEN:         ** We can use the component with < SomeComponent />

    -Working with "props" &                     * SCENARIO:     ** We need to pass in data to a component (ex: We need different titles for the same component spawned 3 times)
     Dynamic Content:                           
                                                * HOW:          ** Pass the values by defining attributes (they can be any name)
                                                                        *** < SomeComponent someAttrib1="someVal" someAttrib2="SomeVal" />
                                                                ** Accept the attributes by defining a props parameter in your component.
                                                                        *** function SomeComponent(props) {} //props has those attributes as properties
                                                                ** To use the properties we can't simply use props.someAttrib1 in JSX. WE HAVE TO WRAP DYNAMIC
                                                                   CONTENT FROM JavaScript WITH {}

    -Handling Events:                           * SCENARIO:     ** We need to listen to a click on a Components button

                                                * HOW:          ** PREREQ: The HTML elements in REACT are really just REACT components built into it
                                                                ** The previous statement matters because we can add built-in attributes that don't exist in HTML
                                                                   such as the:          onClick={ someFunctionDefinedElsewhere} //don't use () because it'll execute

                                                * USEFUL:       * For functions that need to reference properties from props. You should define them inside of
                                                                  the main Component.
