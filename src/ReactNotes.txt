REACT SUMMARY & CORE FEATURES
    -How React Works and                        * A Component is a regular JS function that returns something that can be rendered ( Ex: plain text, but usually JSX (JS HTML) )
     Understanding Components:                  * These components should reside in their own .js files and be exported in a CommonJS style (Ex: export default App;)

    -Building & Re-Using Another                * CONVENTION:   ** Place new .js components in a ./src/components directory
     Component:                                                 ** Component names should start with a capital letter (ex: function SomeComponent() {})

                                                * Import with:  ** import SomeComponent from './components/SomeComponent'
                                                
                                                * THEN:         ** We can use the component with < SomeComponent />
